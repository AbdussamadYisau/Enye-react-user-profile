# Enye Frontend Challenge
The purpose is to gauge your understanding of working with JSON data with various RESTful APIs. In this challenge, we provide a [sample API](https://api.enye.tech/v1/challenge/records) with a single endpoint and ask you to write some Javascript to request data from the API and transform the response.

## Tasks

1. Using the Profiles API, create a UI that presents the information intuitively and beautifully
2. Only 20 profiles **must** be listed on a page, so pagination is needed 
3. Your application **must** incorporate two (2) filters to dynamically present the information (i.e. filter by gender, payment method, credit card type, etc.)
4. Your application **must** include a search bar to search for a specific patient
5. Your application front-end **must** be written using ReactJS
6. The application **must** be deployed to the web
